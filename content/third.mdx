# Getting Started with Next.js for Blogs

Welcome to my very first post on this blog! üöÄ

In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through why I chose **Next.js** for building this blog and how **MDX** makes writing content as fun as writing code.

## ‚ú® Why Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to:

- Build fast, SEO-friendly web apps
- Use server-side rendering and static site generation
- Easily manage routes and page layouts
- Add MDX support for writing blogs in Markdown + JSX

Whether you're building a personal portfolio or a full CMS, Next.js scales with you.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing with MDX

MDX lets you write articles like this using **Markdown**, and even embed React components directly in your content. For example:

```tsx
<CustomAlert type="info">
  You can render React components like this inside your blog post!
</CustomAlert>
